# Increasing the retention rate by analyzing user behavior
## What is retention rate?
- the percentage of new users who remain active after a given period.
- retention formula : 
$$Retention \space Rate =\Sigma_{i,j}^n \frac{AU_j}{DAU_i} \times 100\\% $$
- $DAU_i$ : daily new user numbers in ith day after product launching.
- $AU_j$ : active user numbers in jth day relative the each $DAU_i.


## Why retention rate is important?
- Because it affects the revenue according to formula: $Revenue = AU \times ARPU$.
- Users will pay only if they want to play, which means they must be active at first.
- Higher retention rate means more active users, then developers have the chance to increase $ARPU$ later on.

## What is the problem?
- The retention rate of our product is **lower** than the average retention rate of A-class products in the market.
- The ARPU of our proudct is slightly lower than other A-class products.

- The retention rate in Day1(called R1) decreases the most compare with other days.

## What is the project goal?

- Increasing the retention rate in Day1(R1) by analyzing the user behavior.


### How to define success for this project?

- Figure out what user behavior would lead higher retention rate.
- Figure out the insight from the user behavior.
- Provide suggestion that stakeholder can accept.
- Run a A/B test to show difference.

## Analysis procedures

- Identify the user status by key metrics that relevant to R1.
- Segment the users into groups by the metrics.
- Idenitfy significant difference in retention rate between groups.
- Look for user behavior patterns that associated with the user status.
- Find the reason behind


#### The key metrics


## What is the key user behavior




### What is the pattern of those players at their 1st day

- data visualization

### Which behavior highly correlated with this pattern


### Why is that behavior
- it's the major contribution of character ability
- players who invest more behave better than those who don't(they also know that system)


## A/B test

- show how many steps to get into
