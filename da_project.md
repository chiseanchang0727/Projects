# Increasing the retention rate by identifying the key user behavior in the first game day

## What is retention rate?
- the percentage of new users who remain active after a given period.
- retention formula : 
$$Retention \space Rate =\Sigma_{i,j}^n \frac{AU_j}{DAU_i} \times 100\\% $$
- $DAU_i$ : daily new user numbers in ith day after product launching
- $AU_j$ : active user numbers in jth day relative the each $DAU_i


## Why retention rate is important?
- Because it affects the revenue according to formula: $Revenue = AU \times ARPU$
- Users will pay only if they want to play, which means they must be active at first
- Higher retention rate means more active users, then developers have the chance to increaase $ARPU$ later on.

## What is the problem: 
- The retention rate is lower than the average retention rate in the game market.

## What is the project goal:

- Increasing the 1st day retention rate by identifying the key user behavior 


## How to define success for this project?

- Figure out what user behavior would lead higher retention rate
- Figure out the insight from the user behavior
- Provide suggestion that stakeholder can accept
- Run a A/B test to show difference


## Why is 1st day?

- retention rate decrease the most


## What is the key user behavior

prove from backwards

### Players who play at least 3 days 
- why 3 days

### What is the pattern of those players at their 1st day

- data visualization

### Which behavior highly correlated with this pattern


### Why is that behavior
- it's the major contribution of character ability
- players who invest more behave better than those who don't(they also know that system)


## Suggestions

- show how many steps to get into 


## Possible A/B test
