# Increasing the retention rate by analyzing the user behavior

## What kind of problem we are tackling: 
- Increasing the average retention rate of 1st day, 2nd day, 3rd day after users starting playing
- retention formula : $$Retention_i = \frac{user number in ith day}{daily new user of each date}$$
- (retention rate visualization)

## Why retention rate is important?
- the revenue formula is following: $Revenue = AU \times ARPU$
where $AU$ = user number, $ARPU$ = average revenue per user
